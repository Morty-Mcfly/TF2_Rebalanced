	The Ambassador as-is in vanilla TF2 is pretty undesirable. It takes thousands of hours to master, and is a direct downgrade from stock if you aren't breathing on your opponent

	You should be rewarded for precision, regardless of range, although 102 damage from across the map should only come from Sniper, not Spy (even that's debatable)

	The following changes have been made:

		- Removed critical hit damage falloff

	function Ambassador(weapon, player) {
		weapon.AddAttribute("revolver use hit locations", 1, -1)	//	Use body groups. Allows Ambassador to headshot
		weapon.AddAttribute("damage penalty",0.85,-1)				//	Reduce damage by 15% so headshots do 102 damage
		weapon.AddAttribute("fire rate penalty",1.2,-1)				//	20% slower firing speed


	}

	RegisterCustomWeapon("Ambassador 2", "Ambassador", false, Ambassador,null, null)	//register the revamped Ambassador
